# heat-diffusion-nano-materials
Leveraging the computational power of C++, I designed a framework for simulating nanoscale systems with high precision. Complementing this, a Python program was developed to process and visualize the data as 2D heatmaps, enabling detailed analysis of material properties at the nanoscale.
